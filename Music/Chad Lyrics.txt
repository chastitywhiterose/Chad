There was a man who’s name was Chad
When he was near the people were glad
At playing sports he was not bad
He was a 25 year old college grad

He was the town’s best soccer star
He drove a really fancy car
He was really strong and could open a jar
His eating habits were kind of bizarre

He loved animals and didn’t eat meat
He ate cold watermelon in the summer heat
His muscular strength just couldn’t be beat
His friends thought he was kind of neat

Some don’t like Chad’s special ways
He is straight but friends with gays
He is a good man who spends his days
Taking care of animal strays
