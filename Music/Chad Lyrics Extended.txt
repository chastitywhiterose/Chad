There was a man who’s name was Chad
When he was near the people were glad
At playing sports he was not bad
He was a 25 year old college grad

He was the town’s best soccer star
He drove a really fancy car
He was really strong and could open a jar
His eating habits were kind of bizarre

He loved animals and didn’t eat meat
He ate cold watermelon in the summer heat
His muscular strength just couldn’t be beat
His friends thought he was kind of neat

Some don’t like Chad’s special ways
He is straight but friends with gays
He is a good man who spends his days
Taking care of animal strays

His longest childhood friend was Matt
For hours on end they both sat
Playing chess while having a chat
Talking about this and that

Chad had a friend who loved animals too
Her name was Stacy and her words were true
She cheered Chad up when he felt blue
At the animal shelter their friendship grew

Chad had the longest winning streak
When he played soccer every week
He often prayed to God at the creek
And asked for words that he must speak



---
The people in town thought Chad was cool
He tried to follow the Golden Rule
They knew Chad was not a fool
