# The Story of Chad

Chastity White Rose

# Introduction

The following story you are about to read started as an assignment for my Creative Writing course with Full Sail University. It started as a joke, but then it turned quite serious and emotional.

Chad is your most basic Cisgender Straight White man who is actually quite different from me. Chad is obviously a fictional character, but he is based on expectations of what society expects him to be. He also desires the approval of his parents. He is written to be a relatable character, as you will see as the story continues.

I developed more elements of the characters for assignments in other classes. After I graduated in July 2025, I began work on turning this into a complete story. I hope you enjoy this story.

# Chapter 1: Chad plays soccer with his friends

Chad was a busy man. Chad was a rich and popular man in his small town. He lived in a quiet, small town in Missouri named Podunk, where everyone went to church on Sunday, and even gas stations were closed on Sunday to honor what the Christians called the Lord's Sabbath. Chad had just graduated from college, and his career was in sports. He loved Soccer the most, but he played a little bit of Tennis and Basketball in college and high school. Chad had plenty of friends, and most of the girls had fantasies about him because he was also stereotypically attractive. His scholarships and income from always being the top sports player had left him very rich, and so he did not need to work a regular job like most people.

However, he volunteered his time at any type of charity organization or church event. He mowed the lawn and fixed things at the Crisis Pregnancy Center, and was a janitor at the animal shelter. He had plenty of time to do these jobs whenever he wasn't playing sports. He played sports for money but also with his friends for fun.

Chad played Soccer one Tuesday afternoon with three of his friends. He was on Matthew's team, and they were playing against Luke and John. Chad and Matthew beat the other team 15 to 5, with Chad scoring 12 of the goals. After the game, they all ordered Pizza from Sarpino's and then talked about their lives. They all had a debate over what the sermon was about the previous Sunday.

The conversation went like this:

"Hey Chad, we sure had a good game. I know I wouldn't have won if I weren't on your team," said Matthew.

"Hey Matt, don't be so hard on yourself. If you would like, I could help train you to kick the ball where you're trying to," said Chad.

"Thanks, Chad! By the way, what did you think about the sermon on Sunday?" said Matthew.

"Can you remind me what it was? I wasn't paying any attention. I just go so my dad doesn't say I am not a Christian," said Chad.

"I remember it. Pastor Mark was reading from Romans chapter 1," said Luke.
"That's right, it was about idolatry. People created things that they worshipped instead of God, who created those things," said John.

"I don't remember that part at all. I was talking about verses 24 to 27, where it says God gave people over to their sexual desires. What do you guys think that was about?" said Matthew.

"I guess it's about people who make their sexual desires an idol that is more important than God. It's all part of the same thing, really," said John.

"No, it's not that at all. Clearly, it was talking about homosexuals and how their desires are so sinful that even God must give up on them and leave them to live out their sins," said Luke.

"So, does that mean that if someone's desires are sinful, God has abandoned them?" said Matthew.

"Who cares? It's not like any of us has anything to worry about. We are Christians, and we are straight, exactly like God intended us to be!" said Luke

"Especially you, Luke. I know you were looking at Stacy the whole time. Maybe she's your idol," said John.

"Hey, I'm just appreciating God's divine art!" said Luke.

"Watch out, Luke! Stacy is the pastor's daughter! Get too close, and you will still face the wrath of God!" said Chad.

"Better worry about your sins, Chad! You have the sin of greed because you take all the girls," said Luke.

"I can't help it. The girls all come to me. Maybe I can send some of the girls your way, and you can leave Stacy alone," said Chad.

"I see how it is! The real reason you come to church is also to have a chance with Stacy," said Luke.

"Yeah, you caught me! You'll have to beat me in sports first before you fight over girls with me," said Chad.

"Fair enough, Chad!" said Luke.

The four friends continued to talk about many different things as they ate pizza and laughed. Chad felt a little bit uncomfortable because he lied to his friend Luke. The truth is that he pretended to be interested in dating Stacy because he didn't like the way Luke was talking about Stacy. She was just an idol to Luke, and Chad agreed with John. He also noticed that Matthew had gone silent as the other three talked for the rest of the night. Chad decided to talk to Matthew about it more when the two of them were alone. Something was bothering Matthew, but Chad did not know why. Since when did Matthew listen to the sermons or read the Bible? Chad and his friends had certainly grown up around Christian influence, but they never had conversations like this before.

# Chapter 2: Chad meets another Vegan

Chad was a Vegan and did not eat or wear animal products. Whenever his friends questioned him about why he didn't eat the same foods as they did at social events, he said he ate only plants because it was healthier, and he was a sportsman who needed to be in top physical condition. All of this was true, but it wasn't the most important reason. The truth
was that he did not want to eat animals because he believed killing them was wrong. He knew this idea would be mocked in his conservative religious town. Even his own family ate mostly meat and cheese, but they never questioned his diet; after all, they knew he was health-conscious.

Chad did have a reputation for being an animal lover, but in the town of Podunk, everyone called themselves animal lovers, but they were not vegan. Their love for animals extended only to dogs and cats. Chad volunteered at the animal shelter and cleaned up after the animals. He really wanted to be around all kinds of animals, but this was the best his town had to offer if someone wanted to be around a species other than humans.

Most of all, Chad loved dogs, though. He had a Golden Retriever that he played sports with. The reason that Chad loved the game of Soccer more than other sports was that it was the easiest sport for his dog to play with him. Chad loved playing with his dog more than other humans because his dog would not judge him when he missed the goal or for
anything else about him. He always said a dog was man's best friend.

As Chad cleaned the cages, Stacy, who also worked there, feeding all the animals, noticed how the dogs seemed to love him. She decided to start a conversation.

"The dogs seem to really like you!" said Stacy.

"I think it's because I understand dogs because of my dog. Dogs like to play just as much as humans do," said Chad.

"What's your dog's name?" said Stacy.

"Gold General," said Chad.

"Why that name?" said Stacy.

"The Gold General is a piece in the Japanese game of Shogi. Also, my dog is a Golden Retriever, so it was the first thing that popped into my head when I got him," said Chad.

"That makes perfect sense. Do you play Shogi? What is it like?" said Stacy.

"It's actually a lot like chess, except it has a few pieces that standard chess doesn't have. Do you play chess?" said Chad.

"A little bit, but I have no one to play with, so I am not very good. I learned from my dad years ago," said Stacy.

"I will tell you what, how about I coach you in chess and also teach you Shogi? I have a collection of board games at home," said Chad.

"Sounds fun, but when are you going to have time for that? Aren't you the number one sports star in the town?" said Stacy.

"Yeah, but the big games are only once a month. I practice every day with my dog, and once a week, I get together with my friends and play Soccer and sometimes basketball. I have time to do things like volunteer here and help my parents with chores sometimes," said Chad.

"You're not like the other guys in this town, Chad," said Stacy.

"How so? Is that good or bad?" said Chad.

"It's good. What I mean is that you have everything someone could want. You have money, fame, looks, and the nicest car in town. In spite of all this, you are cleaning up dog poop at an animal shelter! Most people in this town think that jobs like this are beneath their dignity and that animals are not as important as humans," said Stacy:

"Sometimes I like animals more than humans. I don't even eat them because animals are friends, not food!" said Chad.

"You're a Vegan?" said Stacy.

*"What do I say? I have never told anyone this because I will be the laughingstock of the town if they find out the true reason I don't eat like them."* Chad thought to himself. Even so, Stacy seemed like someone he could trust with this information, too. If there is anyone who might understand, it is her.

"Yes, I stopped eating animals when I was 16. I was always on the go, so I ate mostly fruit for energy. After a while, I noticed that my performance in sports was better when I didn't eat meat, dairy, eggs, or honey. I always felt sick afterward when I ate them with my family," said Chad.

"But it's also because you don't want to hurt the animals, isn't it?" said Stacy.

"Yes, but you can't tell anyone this," said Chad.

"That's silly, why not?" said Stacy.

"It isn't good for my reputation in the sports world and this town to be seen as sensitive and caring towards animals. At best, I will get questions I don't want to answer, and at worst, I will get called a bleeding heart liberal like the people my dad makes fun of," said Chad.

"You really care what others think of you, don't you?" said Stacy.

"I kind of have to. If word gets out that I have views that are seen as political or related to social issues, it could really mess with my sports career. One wrong move, and it's game over, just like chess," said Chad.

"What about what the animals think of you? If you were in their place, would you want those with influence to speak for your rights, or would you accept that their reputation is more important than your own life?" said Stacy.

This statement by Stacy cut Chad to his core. He never thought about such a thing before. What kind of coward was he that he cared so much about what others would think if they knew he was a Vegan?

"You know what, Stacy, you're right. If I were in their place, I would expect myself to be better than I currently am. I am sorry," said Chad.

"Who are you apologizing to?" said Stacy.

"The animals that were killed and tortured because I was silent and cared more about myself than I did their lives. I didn't even think about that," said Chad.

"Chad, you're really not like the other people in this town. You really do have the love of Christ in you. Don't worry, I will keep your secret, and only you can decide what to do with your life; I was just thinking out loud. I am sorry if I came across as harsh," said Stacy.

"No, Stacy, that's the most honest thing I have ever heard anyone in this small town say to me in my life. I do want to be a better voice for the animals, but I am still afraid," said Chad.

"I am afraid too sometimes. My family doesn't approve of me being vegan, and they say God intended humans to eat animals. My father quotes bible verses from Genesis and Leviticus at me sometimes when I don't eat with the family because I can't bear to witness them eating my friends," said Stacy.

"That sounds really tough. I wouldn't know how to deal with that. I have never really dealt with conflict or controversy because I just say what I think will make others happy. Anyhow, thanks for talking to me, Stacy," said Chad.

"Anytime, Chad! It was a pleasure," said Stacy.

Chad had met a new friend whom he could trust. He never really talked to Stacy before because she seemed like such a shy girl at church. But now he saw the strength in her voice and the fire in her eyes as she spoke about the animals. Chad and Stacy talked about many things on the days they both worked at the animal shelter. They became the best of friends, but it was their secret that no one else knew.

# Chapter 3: The Secrets of Chad and Matt

Chad had made a promise to help train his friend Matt in soccer. Matt
did not play professionally, but he was a friend that Chad had played
with since childhood. The two did almost everything together.

One day, Chad called and asked Matt when they could schedule a time to
practice soccer. Matt suggested Wednesday afternoon before church. They
agreed to meet at 4 PM and practice for fun, and Chad would help Matt
get better at soccer.

Chad gave him some tips that Matthew understood, and they did have some
fun, but then Matt suddenly turned serious and asked.

"Chad, why are you helping me? It's not like I play in your league, and you have more important things to do," said Matt

"More important than playing with my best friend? Nonsense!" said Chad.

"We are friends no matter what, right, Chad?" asked Matt.

"Of course, till death do us part!" joked Chad

"Chad, there is something I need to tell you. I have done something horrible," said Matt.

"Whatever you have done, I can forgive you. I am here if you need to talk about it," said Chad.

"Thanks, Chad. I seem to have a problem with a porn addiction. I don't
feel right about it, but sometimes I watch porn and pretend in my mind
that I am one of those people. I can't have a marriage like other people, and sometimes I get jealous of those people I see in movies and
even some porn sites," said Matt

"No need to feel that way, Matt. You're a good guy, and I am sure you'll
find the right woman one day," said Chad.

"Chad, that's the problem. I am not looking for a woman. I am attracted
to men. I'm gay, and I watch gay porn," said Matt.

"Well, I didn't see that one coming. Wait, gay porn exists? Is that even
legal?" said Chad.

"Chad, none of it is legal, but the internet can be a scary place
sometimes. Sometimes, I see things I shouldn't, and I lose control
because I enjoy seeing them, but later, I feel guilty about it. I
promise myself that I won't look again, but then I remember what I saw, and I want to see it again because it made me feel something. It is as
if there is a part of myself I have never understood," said Matt.


"I don't know what you mean at all," said Chad.


"Chad, do you remember how you felt the first time you saw a naked
girl?" asked Matt.


"No, I have never seen a naked girl. I never hope to see one. But I can
tell you anyhow I would rather see than be one," said Chad.

"What do you mean, Chad? You dated just about every cheerleader in high school," said Matt.

"Some of them asked me out, but then they kind of lost interest when my
idea of a date was playing soccer. A few times, we went out to dinner or
a movie and had some good conversations, but that was all that
happened," said Chad.

"Chad, are you sure you're straight?" asked Matt.

"Beats me. I guess I will find out when I get married. I am saving
myself for marriage. I am a Christian and a virgin," said Chad.

"So you're not mad at me for falling into sin," asked Matt.

"I don't really know. In any case, it's not my place to judge. That's
between you and God. But perhaps I can distract you from the porn with a good game of soccer. If that doesn't work, there is always the board
game of chess! "Thanks, Chad. Please don't tell anyone about my secret, though," said Matt.

"I will keep your secret if you keep my secret about being a virgin,"
said Chad.

"Chad, we have a deal!" said Matt.

After this conversation, Chad and Matt had a better understanding of
each other. Before this, Chad had never known Matt was gay, but what
difference did it make? They had been friends since they were babies
because all the children in the town had played together in this very
tight-knit community.

Matt was actually more surprised that Chad was a virgin. It was unheard of for a man of his age to have never had sex with anyone. Of course, it
was against the teachings of the church for anyone to have sex outside
of marriage, but it still happened all the time, and so Matt had falsely
assumed Chad was like the rest.


If anything was clear, it was that Chad really was not like the other
guys. He looked like a man. Chad had the best success and reputation in
town, but his heart was kind. That day, Matt learned that he could talk
to Chad about anything.

# Chapter 4: The Town Soccer Game

Chad was scheduled to participate in the annual Soccer game between the Podunk Stallions against the Applewood Dragons. He decided to let his friends know because they always came to his games to cheer him on.

He called Matt, Luke, and John. Of course, they spread the word to
everyone else in the small town that on August 2nd, Chad would be
playing as the team captain as usual. Luke's father, Levi, was the
coach for the town's team and the biggest sports fan there was, so people quickly found out about the event.

In the meantime, Matt greatly improved his soccer game skills thanks to his practice with Chad.

"I see you have really improved with your kicking aim. Are you ready for a challenge?" said Chad.

"What kind of challenge did you have in mind?" said Matt.

"I want you to play against my dog, Gold General," said Chad.

"I didn't know your dog played soccer!" said Matt.

"He does! I mean, he can't kick the ball with a human foot, but he makes a great goalie. He can bounce back any ball, even if it's flying through the air. Come here, boy! Stand at the goal and try to block Matt's kicks!" said Chad.

Much to Matt's surprise, Gold General stood in front of the goal.
Clearly, he had done this before. Matt kicked the ball towards the goal
several times. The dog blocked 7 of 10 shots, but Matt kicked the ball
so fast that it flew even before the dog could see and react to it.

"3 out of 10 isn't bad. Good job, Matt," said Chad.

"It doesn't sound very good," said Matt.

"Are you kidding me? This dog can dodge better than Luke or John can. He can block things more efficiently because he hears the sound of the ball and knows what direction it is going in. More importantly, if Gold General had not been there, you would have made all ten. You were in the window of the goal because your aim has improved. You don't miss the goal entirely anymore," said Chad.

"Thanks, Chad! I owe it all to your help. By the way, I am totally coming to your game against the Dragons next week!" said Matt.

"You better! I don't want to drag you there myself!" said Chad.

"Count on it, Chad!" said Matt.

The day came for the big soccer game. It was not a big event by any
means nationally, and you would not have heard about it in the news, but
to the people in Podunk, this is their greatest thrill. Luke also played
in this game because he was second only to Chad when it came to strength and speed. Of course, by being the son of the coach, his father would have made him come to the game whether he was playing or not.

The game went on for 4 hours, and everyone was tired. However, Podunk
won 36 to 25. The other team was good too, but they couldn't match the
leadership and strategy of Chad, nor the strength of the kick from
Podunk's best players, some of whom practiced every single day.

Because everyone was hungry, the whole town had a meal. It was nothing
special because it was all hamburgers and hot dogs. Chad went to his car
to pull out a large watermelon and a bottle of water he kept cold in a
cooler full of ice. The ice had melted, but the watermelon was nice and
cold, just the way he liked it in the summer heat.

Chad came back with the watermelon and set it on an empty table. His
friends sat around him as he ate. It was always a spectacle to see Chad
devour a watermelon because nobody ate like him. This time, Stacy also
sat down with them, and they all had a conversation.

"How do you keep up your strength, Chad? I would expect you to eat 8 hot dogs after a game like that," said John.

"John, have you ever tried eating a whole watermelon? It is
full of water, which is what I need after playing in this heat," said Chad.

"Fair enough, Chad. I guess I should try it sometime!" said John.

"Come to think of it, I have never even seen you eat meat. How do you get your protein?" said Luke.

"Have you ever tried Tofu sandwiches, Luke?" said Chad.

"What kind of sissy do you think I am? Real men eat meat. I bet I
could beat you in a one-on-one match," said Luke.

"What's wrong with being a sissy, Luke? Don't you have a sister?
That's what a sissy literally means," said Stacy.

"Yeah, that's fine for women, but men need calories because we do the most physical tasks and need more food," said Luke.

"And you think women don't do hard work? They do housework and give birth to babies. I think they should be given a watermelon and a tofu sandwich after that," said Chad.

"Chad, since when did you become a feminist?" said Luke,

"What's a feminist? Anyhow, if you will kindly leave me to my watermelon, the sissy princess needs her food after dominating the soccer game. But I will take you up on the soccer challenge," said Chad.

"Alright, Chad, I am going to go eat some real food. Catch you later!" said Luke."

Luke left to get some hot dogs and chips. The others continued speaking.

"Nice response, Chad. Most guys would have gotten angry at being
insulted like Luke was doing to you," said Stacy.

"Don't worry about Luke. He's just mad because I get all the
attention for sports. In fact, he deserves credit for part of the
victory. He is a great guy as long as he plays sports and keeps his
mouth shut," said Chad.

"That's what I am worried about. From the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks," said Stacy.

"Luke would do well to read the book he was named after," said John.

"So would you, John!" said Chad.

"You're not wrong, Chad! My favorite verse is actually John 3:16: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life," said John.

"Great way to tell me you don't read the bible without telling me you don't read the bible. Everyone knows that verse because it's the most popular," said Chad.

"Yes, but it's still a good verse!" said John

"I think the verse right after it is even better. John 3:17: For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved," said Matt.

Everyone had a good time as they ate and talked about their favorite bible verses. Everyone had a good time except for Luke, who really didn't like the interaction he had with Chad and was standing in the distance, eating hot dogs. He looked at Chad with jealousy because Chad was the star. Everyone liked Chad more than they liked him, even Stacy.

# Chapter 5: Jealousy is Gross

Luke had always been a little jealous of Chad because it seemed like he
always got more attention from everyone in the town, especially the
ladies. It wasn't that Chad had better achievements or looks than Luke.
In fact, if you had seen them side by side, you would probably expect
Luke is to be the star of the soccer team and beloved by all.

What Luke did not understand was that the things he said made people
uncomfortable. People also didn't know him as well because he was not a
volunteer at church events. He also did not even know that Chad or Stacy
worked at the animal shelter because he had never been in there. All he knew was that if he wanted to make Stacy his girlfriend, he was going to
need Chad out of the picture, and he started forming a plan. But first,
he needed to find a weakness in Chad that he could exploit to bring him
down, just like political candidates do to their opponents.

Luke remembered that there was a town newspaper that everyone read. He
decided to see Gabby at the office of the Podunk Times.

Luke: Hello Gabby, can you tell me more about the newspaper and what you
do?

Gabby: Sure, Luke. People in the town tell me stories they have of
events going on, such as sports games or local politics.

Luke: I think I may have a story for you, but I need to do some research.
Can I buy any back issues that mention Chad, the soccer team captain?

Gabby: Every issue's sports section has stuff on Chad! He is a champion who wins at soccer, basketball, tennis, and even volleyball.

Luke: I know Gabby! He is a legend, but the question remains: why is he
so successful? What are his secrets? Yeah, he is skilled and talented, but
there must be something about his training methods or diet that leads
him to victory.

Gabby: You have a point! I should really interview him and ask him! In the meantime, take a look at the archives on the wall over there and see
If you find anything relevant.

Luke: Thanks for your time, Gabby! If I find anything relevant, I will
mention it to you.

Gabby: Thanks a lot, Luke! Have you considered working for the newspaper?

Luke: I didn't know there was an available job.

Gabby: There usually is. If nothing else, I could use help with delivery!

Luke: I would be glad to help. Here is my phone number. Call me if you
need help. If I am not busy, I will come right over.

Gabby planned to interview Chad. She went to his house one day, and the
The door was answered by his Father, Bob.

"Hello Gabby, what can I do for you today?" said Bob

"Hello Bob, is Chad available? I want to interview him about his recent
soccer victory," said Gabby.

"He's not here at the moment, but your best bet is to go to the animal
shelter where he volunteers for a few hours every day," said Bob.

"What a surprise, I never would have guessed that he volunteered there!"
said Gabby.

"Well, if you know anything about Chad, you'll know that he is always
doing what he can to serve others," said Bob.

"Thanks, Bob! And say hello to your wife, Alice, for me!" said Gabby.

Gabby went to the animal shelter. It was the only animal shelter in town, and so it didn't exactly have a name. Everyone knew where it was,
although it didn't get very many visitors. Gabby walked in and was
greeted by Stacy.

"Hello Gabby, what brings you to this corner of town?" said Stacy.

"I heard I might find Chad here to interview him about the recent win of his soccer team," said Gabby.

"Then take a look around because Chad cleans up after the animals every
morning before he practices soccer at noon," said Stacy.

Gabby looked around and found Chad cleaning the large cages where each
cat or dog had food, water, and a bed. Some of them also had toys they
played with. The cats seemed especially interested in Gabby and were
watching her. They were not used to seeing anyone other than Chad and
Stacy, because it had been a long time since other humans had visited.

"Chad? What is a soccer champion like you doing here?" said Gabby.

"Just getting my hands dirty for Jesus!" said Chad.

"That's really sweet, Chad, but what do you mean?" asked Gabby.

"Read Matthew chapter 25, verses 34 through 40. Then you will understand,
said Chad.

Gabby did not read the bible outside of church occasionally and did not
own one, but she took a minute to search the internet on her phone and
found what Chad was talking about.

______

Matthew 25:34 "Then the King will say to those on his right,
'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the
world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'

37 "Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we
see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to
drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in,
or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you
sick or in prison and go to visit you?'

40 "The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did
for me.'

______

"Chad, I understand now. You are saying that what Jesus said about
taking care of others applies to the animals, too. I guess I never
thought about it," said Gabby.
"That's how I see it anyway. What brings you to the animal shelter? Did
you come to adopt someone?" asked Chad.
"Actually, I came to interview you about your victory in the soccer game
against the Applewood Dragons. Do you have any words about why you think
you won the game?" asked Gabby.
"I think that we have a good team, and they follow my orders very well.
I always tell them that if someone is in their path to the
goal, they shouldn't try to kick the ball towards the goal. The best thing is
to pass it backward for the element of surprise. While they are trying
to block the goal, the ball is sent back to the star kickers: Todd, Steve, Luke, or me. Then we kick it from far away, and the opposing team is running in our direction, and their goalie can't always block the ball. To sum it up, the strength we have is teamwork and strategy," said Chad.

"That's a lot of information, Chad! It will make a great article if you don't mind me sharing it in the local paper," said Gabby.

"I don't mind at all, but can you also mention in your paper about the
animals here who need someone to adopt them?" asked Chad.

"I sure will! Thank you for your time and for giving me the best story I have heard of this year," said Gabby.

Gabby left and went back to the newspaper office, where she wrote the following story in the sports section of the newspaper:

"Chad, the team captain of the Podunk Stallions, credits his great team
for their teamwork in executing the strategy he comes up with for the
game. He is a very humble man who always serves others in need. Chad
takes care of animals at the animal shelter on the southeast corner of
Podunk. He suggests reading Matthew chapter 25, which says that if we do
good things for animals are doing them for Jesus as well. Chad wanted to
let everyone know that many animals are in need of a home and to do for
them as you would want done for you."

When the newspaper was ready, Gabby called Luke and asked if he would
like to deliver some newspapers. He came and read the section about had
in the paper before making deliveries. Luke started seeing how important
these animals were to Chad. He also knew that this would only increase
Chad's reputation as being the kind Christian man the whole town knew he was. Luke knew that if he wanted to overthrow Chad as the star of the
town, he would need to find a way to exploit Chad's love for animals
against him.

But how would he do it? Chad was perfect morally, physically,
financially, and spiritually. He couldn't find a weakness here but kept
trying to plot something. He should have been happy for Chad, but
instead, his jealousy turned into hatred.

# Chapter 6: Unwanted Fame

The newspaper article Gabby had written after her interview with Chad was read by every person in town. It seemed only to make Chad more popular and also inspired more people to visit the animal shelter. Few people had even been aware that there was an animal shelter in the corner of town,

Stacy was a little bit shy around people, and she was not quite prepared to have so many people visit the animal shelter. People were adopting dogs and cats until only a few were left. Chad was glad he had inspired people to at least care about the dogs and cats, though he was not sure if anyone was aware that he was a vegan who cared about all the animals, not just dogs and cats.

Luke wanted to damage Chad's reputation somehow. He hadn't figured out a way, but watched and listened to anything happening in Chad's life that he could exploit. He decided to visit pastor Mark to see what he thought about Chad.

"Hello Luke, is there something I can help you with?" asked Mark.

"Yes, Pastor Mark, I was wondering if you had any ideas how we could get the church involved with sports activities for kids. Maybe people like me and Chad could teach children to play sports and train the next generation, both as sports players but also teach them the Bible and the Christian message," said Luke.

"That's a fine idea, but why the sudden interest?" said Mark.

"I was reading Chad's story in the newspaper about the animal shelter and I thought Chad's fame could help bring people to church more often, maybe even some more donations from soccer fans who want to donate to the children's ministry because this town is known for having the best soccer team in the area," said Luke.

"It sounds like a perfect idea. Have you mentioned it to Chad yet?" said Mark.

"Not yet, I just wanted to get your input on it so that we can use the church property to hold events," said Luke.

"OK then, tell Chad and anyone you know about your idea," said Mark.

A few days later, Luke went to the animal shelter to tell Chad about this idea.

"Hey Chad, I just got permission from pastor Mark for an idea I had of teaching soccer to children near the church. Do you want to join?" said Luke.

"Of course I am in, I love to teach almost as much as I like to play. Let's get Matt and John in the game with us!" said Chad.

"Hey Stacy, are you going to join us?" said Luke.

"What for? I don't play soccer," Said Stacy.

"Oh, I forgot to mention, this will also be an extension to the children's ministry. You can read the Bible to them or do another activity you like with them if you're interested," said Luke.

"I'll think about it," said Stacy.

After Luke left, Chad asked Stacy a question.

"Stacy, you seemed hesitant to join Luke's new activities with the children. Is anything wrong?" said Chad.

"To be honest, I don't trust Luke very much. Since when did he care about children or the church? He is up to something. Besides that, I am under enough pressure from my family who want me to be a normal woman and get married and have children at my age. The last thing I need is more time in the spotlight. You're famous, Chad, but I prefer to keep my life private," said Stacy.

"Understood, Stacy, but if you ever change your mind, let me know. You're a great person and the kids will love you," said Chad.

"I do not doubt that. I just prefer not to be in crowds of people and noisy children," said Stacy.

# Chapter 7: Questionable Intentions

The next Sunday, Pastor Mark announced that Chad and Luke were volunteering to teach soccer to children for an hour after church each Sunday morning. He asked people to bring their children who were interested in soccer, food, fun, and Bible stories. He asked for more volunteers, including his daughter Stacy, who was not fully on board with it all.

"Stacy, are you going to join the activities with Chad and Luke on Sunday afternoons with the children?" said Mark.

"No, I think I will stay out of it. I don't have anything to contribute, and I would rather stay out of the summer heat," said Stacy.

"But the girls could probably look up to a female role model if you were present. It wouldn't be right to only have Chad, Matthew, Luke, and John be the only adults present," said Mark.

"Are you saying I am only of use for being an adult female so that the girls don't feel left out?" said Stacy.

"No, I also think you need to do something other than waste your time volunteering at the animal shelter," said Mark.

"It's not a waste of time! Even Chad sees it as an integral part of his Christianity to serve others and do for them what he would do for Jesus!" said Stacy. He explained that to Gabby when she interviewed him for the paper," said Stacy.

"I am sorry, I didn't mean a waste of time, but you are 25 years old and you need to get a job that pays, or at least find a rich husband. What about that Chad fellow? He is rich and a Christian. Since you like him so much, you really should help him with the children," said Mark.

"I see, this is part of your scheme to get me out of the house and married off to a rich dude. Fine, I will join Chad and the others with all activities I can, but I am doing it for Jesus, not for you!" said Stacy.

Pastor Mark didn't say anything after that; he knew he was in the wrong, but he cared more about the reputation of the church and his reputation. He couldn't very well have his daughter not participate in church activities because it made him look like a failure if they were not meeting religious or social expectations.

Stacy didn't trust the intentions of Luke for starting this sports ministry, nor her father, who was clearly set on getting her to marry a rich man so he wouldn't be financially responsible for her anymore.

Stacy called Chad and told him she wanted to be involved. They discussed strategies for things she could do for kids when they were tired from playing sports. What she didn't tell him was about her father's plan to set them up romantically. Chad was a friend, and she didn't want to make it weird. Even though she liked him as a person, she wasn't interested in any man, especially a rich sports star, because that is what her father wanted for her.
